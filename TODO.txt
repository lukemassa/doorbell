- Implement test procedure
  - Double press unit 1, get a notification from nfty that test has begun
  - Enters 5 minute period where all normal notification is bypassed, only notify via nfty and only notify me.
- Get ringer for first floor
- Unit tests
- configuration.yaml file
    name, zfty prefix, zfty message, IEEE "name", zfty notification like "options" (priority?)
- fan control
    turn on fan if it gets too hot
    have different thresholds during day vs night
- Validate topic on startup
- Move "decrypt topics" into go
- Figure out why it takes a bit after startup to run
   Have release run some command that waits until ready
   Was this fixed by PID thign?
- Shut down client on stop
- ./bin/doorbell ring should take an option
- Use a different client for local notifications
